# Smart Classroom Allocation System

## üéØ **System Overview**

The Smart Classroom Allocation System is an advanced enhancement to the Smart Classroom Scheduler that implements **dynamic classroom sharing** and **intelligent resource allocation** for educational institutions.

### **Key Problem Solved**
- **Limited classrooms, many students**: When some sections have lab sessions, their regular classrooms become available for temporary allocation to other sections
- **Optimal resource utilization**: Maximize classroom usage through intelligent sharing and priority-based allocation
- **Branch and section management**: Organize students by branches (CSE, ECE, MECH) and sections (A, B, C) for better scheduling

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Core Components**

1. **SmartClassroomAllocator** (`classroom_allocator.py`)
   - Priority-based classroom assignment
   - Dynamic availability checking
   - Temporary allocation during lab sessions
   - Utilization reporting and optimization

2. **Enhanced Models** (`models.py`)
   - Branch/Section support for batches
   - Fixed allocation settings for classrooms
   - Allocation tracking and history

3. **Updated TimetableOptimizer** (`timetable_optimizer.py`)
   - Integration with smart allocator
   - Lab-aware scheduling
   - Block-based allocation support

## üìä **Database Schema Enhancements**

### **Batches Table - New Fields**
```sql

- section VARCHAR(10)              -- e.g., "A", "B", "C"
- priority_for_allocation INT      -- 1=High, 2=Medium, 3=Low
```

- fixed_batch_id INT              -- Reference to assigned batch
- priority_level INT              -- 1=High, 2=Medium, 3=Low priority
- can_be_shared BOOLEAN           -- Can be temporarily allocated to others
```

### **TimetableEntries Table - New Fields**
```sql
- is_temporary_allocation BOOLEAN          -- True if using borrowed classroom
- original_classroom_owner_id INT          -- Original owner batch

```

### **New ClassroomAllocations Table**

- is_active BOOLEAN               -- Active status
```

## üß† **Smart Allocation Algorithm**

### **Priority Scoring System**
The system calculates priority scores for classroom allocation based on:

1. **Batch Priority** (25-100 points)
   - High priority batch: +100 points
   - Medium priority batch: +50 points
   - Low priority batch: +25 points

2. **Fixed Allocation Bonus** (+200 points)
   - Own fixed classroom gets highest priority

3. **Classroom Priority** (15-75 points)
   - High priority classroom: +75 points
   - Medium priority classroom: +40 points
   - Low priority classroom: +15 points

4. **Subject-Room Matching** (+150/-50 points)
   - Lab subjects in lab rooms: +150 points
   - Regular subjects in regular rooms: +50 points
   - Lab subjects in regular rooms: -50 points (penalty)

5. **Capacity Efficiency** (0-30 points)
   - 80-100% utilization: +30 points
   - 60-80% utilization: +20 points
   - 40-60% utilization: +10 points
   - Room too small: -100 points (heavy penalty)

### **Dynamic Sharing Logic**
```python
def check_classroom_availability(classroom, requesting_batch, day_of_week, time_slot):
    if classroom.is_fixed_allocation:
        if classroom.fixed_batch_id == requesting_batch.id:
            return "own_fixed_classroom"
        elif fixed_owner_has_lab_session(day_of_week, time_slot) and classroom.can_be_shared:
            return "temporary_borrow_available"
        else:
            return "unavailable"
    else:
        return "regular_available"
```

## üìà **Usage Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Lab Session Sharing**
```
CSE-A has a fixed classroom "Room-301"
At 10:00 AM on Monday, CSE-A has a lab session in "CSE-Lab-1"
CSE-B needs a classroom at 10:00 AM on Monday

Result: CSE-B gets temporarily allocated "Room-301" 
(CSE-A's fixed classroom) during their lab session
```

### **Scenario 2: Priority-Based Allocation**
```
Available classrooms: Room-302 (capacity: 65, priority: 2)
Requesting batches:
- CSE-A (60 students, high priority) ‚Üí Score: 170
- ECE-B (55 students, medium priority) ‚Üí Score: 120

Result: CSE-A gets Room-302 due to higher priority score
```

### **Scenario 3: Capacity Optimization**
```
Room-301 (capacity: 70)
- CSE-A (60 students) ‚Üí 85% utilization ‚Üí +30 points
- MECH-A (45 students) ‚Üí 64% utilization ‚Üí +20 points

Result: CSE-A preferred for better capacity utilization
```
